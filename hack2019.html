  <h1 class="title"><a href="index.html"> #BlackHack2019 </a></h1>

  <h2>The Purpose!</h2>
  <h4>#BlackHack is an opportunity for black students to come together as a community and share ownership in a project.
    We come together to show that we are here at MIT, we exist, and and we won't back down.  This year's main focus
    is identifying the continuity of student activism on campus, despite efforts to shut down and silence
    our movements.</h4>
